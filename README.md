# bren (Bias Reduction in the Equicorrelated multivariate Normal)
Fits regression for gaussian equicorrelated data using adjusted score functions (bias correction, mean bias reduction, median bias reduction, Jeffreys (power) penalization.
Jeffreys (power) penalization method is robust (i.e. produces reliable confidence intervals) to misspecified correlation structures.

Code related to the paper "Bias reduction and robustness for gaussian longitudinal data analysis" (E. Bortolato, E. C. Kenne Pagui)
to appear in Journal Of Statistical Computation And Simulation.

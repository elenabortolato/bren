# bren (Bias Reduction in the Equicorrelated multivariate Normal)
The function "bren" fits regression for gaussian equicorrelated data using adjusted score functions (bias correction, mean bias reduction, median bias reduction, Jeffreys (power) penalization.
Jeffreys (power) penalization method is robust (i.e. produces reliable confidence intervals) to misspecified correlation structures.

# Stroke example
Real data example of using "bren". It contains the code for reproducing the simulation study in the paper
